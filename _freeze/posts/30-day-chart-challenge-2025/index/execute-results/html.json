Like last year I am going to keep all the prompt posts in one mega-post, adding to it regularly. Perhaps not each day, but I will try to get to every prompt. Like last year:\n\n-   I will post contributions to social media via my [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/gregerskjerulf.bsky.social), and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dubrowg/) accounts.\n-   I will add contributions to this post, meaning the posting date will refresh to the date I've added the chart. So If I get to a lot or even all of them, this will be a long post.\n-   Use the table of contents to the right to navigate to a specific chart.\n-   Images are \"lightboxed\", so click on them to enlarge. Click outside the image to return.\n\nOne major change is that this year I am going to only pull data from Danmarks Statistik (Statistics Danmark, the national statistics agency) via the [`danstat`](https://github.com/ValeriVoev/danstat) package for r. To the extent possible I'll be focusing on education data. These constraints will help me by not having to figure out which data source to use each day, plus I'll hopefully be telling a story of the coming weeks.\n\nIt may not be a straight linear narrative and not every post will necessarily connect to the whole. I may not even know exactly what I have until I'm done. I have sketched out ideas for many of the prompts, but things may change as I go along. If the daily prompt just doesn't lend itself to Danish education data, or Danish data at all, the subject for that chart will be something else.\n\nAs with all of my posts, I'm offering a tutorial/how-to as much as I am trying to convey insights from the data. If a topic or approach interests you, hopefully there's enough explanation in the writing or the code so that you can do something similar or use it to hone your r skills.\n\nLet's get to the charts.\n\n## Prompt #1 - Fractions {#prompt1}\n\nThe first week of prompts is devoted to comparisons, and the first day is fractions. I cheated a bit and replicated last year's 1st prompt [\"Part-to-Whole\"](https://www.gregdubrow.io/posts/30-day-chart-challenge-2024/#prompt1). But where last year I looked at educational attainment in the UK, this year it's Denmark.\n\nI won't do too much explaining about education levels in Denmark, you can read up on them on the [ministry's page](https://ufm.dk/en/education/the-danish-education-system).\n\nWe'll do a horizontal stacked bar chart displaying the highest education attained by Danes aged 25-69 as of 2023, with this population divided into four age groups.\n\nTo pull data from `danstat`, which accesses the Danmarks Statistik API, you have to know at least the table name and number. So it's necessary to poke around Danmarks Statistik's [StatBank page](https://www.statbank.dk/statbank5a/default.asp?w=1680) and figure out which table has the data you need. The value added of the API and package is not having to download and keep flat files.\n\nThe `table_meta` command produces a nested tibble with values for each field in the table. To get the data you first create a list of fields and values (see the `varaibles_ed` object) then use the `get_data` command to actually fetch the data.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .code-overflow-scroll  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show code for getting and cleaning data\"}\nlibrary(tidyverse) # to do tidyverse things\nlibrary(tidylog) # to get a log of what's happening to the data\nlibrary(janitor) # tools for data cleaning\nlibrary(danstat) # package to get Danish statistics via api\nlibrary(ggtext) # enhancements for text in ggplot\n\n# some custom functions\nsource(\"~/Data/r/basic functions.R\")\n\n\n# metadata for table variables, click thru nested tables to find variables and ids for filters\ntable_meta <- danstat::get_table_metadata(table_id = \"hfudd11\", variables_only = TRUE)\n\n# create variable list using the ID value in the variable\nvariables_ed <- list(\n\tlist(code = \"bopomr\", values = c(\"000\", \"081\", \"082\", \"083\", \"084\", \"085\")),\n\tlist(code = \"hfudd\", values = c(\"H10\", \"H20\", \"H30\", \"H35\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"H40\", \"H50\", \"H60\", \"H70\", \"H80\", \"H90\")),\n\tlist(code = \"køn\", values = c(\"TOT\")),\n\tlist(code = \"alder\", values = c(\"25-29\", \"30-34\", \"35-39\", \"40-44\", \"45-49\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"50-54\", \"55-59\", \"60-64\", \"65-69\")),\n\tlist(code = \"tid\", values = 2023))\n\n# past variable list along with table name.\n# note that in package, table name is lower case, though upper case on statbank page.\nedattain1 <- get_data(\"hfudd11\", variables_ed, language = \"da\") %>%\n\tas_tibble() %>%\n\tselect(region = BOPOMR, age = ALDER, edlevel = HFUDD, n = INDHOLD)\n\n# arrange data for chart\n# collapse age and education levels into groups\nedattain <- edattain1 %>%\n\tmutate(age_group = case_when(age %in% c(\"25-29 år\", \"30-34 år\", \"35-39 år\") ~ \"25-39\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tage %in% c(\"40-44 år\",\"45-49 år\") ~ \"40-49\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tage %in% c(\"50-54 år\",\"55-59 år\") ~ \"50-59\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tage %in% c(\"60-64 år\",\"65-69 år\") ~ \"60-69\")) %>%\n\tmutate(ed_group = case_when(edlevel == \"H10 Grundskole\" ~ \"Grundskole/Primary\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tedlevel %in% c(\"H20 Gymnasiale uddannelser\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \"H30 Erhvervsfaglige uddannelser\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \"H35 Adgangsgivende uddannelsesforløb\") ~ \"Secondary\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tedlevel == \"H40 Korte videregående uddannelser, KVU\" ~ \"Tertiary - 2yr\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tedlevel %in% c(\"H50 Mellemlange videregående uddannelser, MVU\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \"H60 Bacheloruddannelser, BACH\") ~ \"Tertiary - Bachelor\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tedlevel == \"H70 Lange videregående uddannelser, LVU\" ~ \"Tertiary - Masters\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tedlevel == \"H80 Ph.d. og forskeruddannelser\" ~ \"Tertiary - PhD\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tedlevel == \"H90 Uoplyst mv.\" ~ \"Not stated\")) %>%\n\tgroup_by(region, age_group, ed_group) %>%\n\tmutate(n2 = sum(n)) %>%\n\tungroup() %>%\n\tselect(-n, -age) %>%\n\tdistinct(region, age_group, ed_group, .keep_all = T) %>%\n\trename(n = n2) %>%\n\tmutate(ed_group =\n\t\t\t\t \tfactor(ed_group,\n\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t levels = c(\"Grundskole/Primary\", \"Secondary\", \"Tertiary - 2yr\",\n\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \"Tertiary - Bachelor\", \"Tertiary - Masters\", \"Tertiary - PhD\", \"Not stated\")))\n\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nNow that we have a nice tidy tibble, let's make a chart. The approach is fairly straight-forward `ggplot`. I used tricks like `fct_rev` to order the age groups on the chart, and the `scales` and `ggtext` packages to make things look nicer.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .code-overflow-scroll  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show code for making the chart\"}\n\n## chart - all DK, horizontal bar age groups, percent stacks percent by deg level\nedattain %>%\n\tfilter(region == \"Hele landet\") %>%\n\tgroup_by(age_group) %>%\n\tmutate(age_total = sum(n)) %>%\n\tmutate(age_pct = round(n/age_total, 2)) %>%\n\tselect(age_group, ed_group, age_pct) %>%\n\t# the line below passes temporary changes to the data object through to the chart commands\n\t{. ->> tmp} %>%\n\tggplot(aes(age_pct, fct_rev(age_group), fill = fct_rev(ed_group))) +\n\tgeom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n\tscale_x_continuous(expand = c(0,0),\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t breaks = c(0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1),\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t labels = c(\"0\", \"25%\", \"50%\", \"75%\", \"100%\")) +\n\tgeom_text(data = subset(tmp, age_pct >0.025),\n\t\t\t\t\t\taes(label = scales::percent(round(age_pct , 2))),\n\t\t\t\t\t\tposition = position_stack(vjust = 0.5),\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcolor= \"white\", vjust = 0.5, size = 12) +\n\tscale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Set3\") +\n\tlabs(title = \"Danes under 40 have a higher rate of post-Bachelor educational attainment than other age groups\",\n\t\t\t subtitle = \"Highest education level attained by age groups\",\n\t\t\t caption = \"*Data from Danmarks Statistik via danstat package*\",\n\t\t\t x = \"\", y = \"Age Group\") +\n\ttheme_minimal() +\n\ttheme(legend.position = \"bottom\", legend.spacing.x = unit(0, 'cm'),\n\t\t\t\tlegend.key.width = unit(4, 'cm'), legend.margin=margin(-10, 0, 0, 0),\n\t\t\t\tlegend.text = element_text(size = 12), legend.title = element_text(size = 16),\n\t\t\t\tplot.title = element_text(hjust = .5, size = 20),\n\t\t\t\tplot.subtitle = element_text(size = 16),\n\t\t\t\tplot.caption = element_markdown(size = 12, face = \"italic\"),\n\t\t\t\taxis.text.x = element_text(size = 14),\n\t\t\t\taxis.text.y = element_text(size = 14),\n\t\t\t\tpanel.grid.major = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor = element_blank()) +\n\tguides(fill = guide_legend(label.position = \"bottom\", reverse = TRUE, direction = \"horizontal\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t nrow = 1,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t title = \"Highest Educational Attainment\", title.position = \"top\")) \nrm(tmp)\n\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n![](images/prompt1_2025.jpg){fig-alt=\"horizontal bar chart showing educational attainment by age group\"}\n\nAs you might expect, younger Danes tend to have higher levels of educational attainment than Danes over 60. That's not uncommmon in countries with post-secondary education policies designed to increase access and attainment. As in the US this is a post-WWII development, though accelerated in the 1960s and after.\n\nIt's been successful public policy in Denmark for many decades to increase access to schooling beyond the Grundskole (primary years...to about grade 9 in a US context). More than 45% of Danes between 25-40 have at least a Bachelor's degree, and 20% have a Master's. There would of course be more nuance in disaggregated age groups, but I wanted to keep this first story a bit more simple.\n\n## Prompt #2 - Slope {#prompt2}\n\nBuilding on what we saw in Prompt 1 for educational attainment by age group in 2023, let's use the slope prompt to compare 2023 to 2005, the furthest back we can get educational attainment by age statistics via Danmarks Statistik's StatBank.\n\nThe process for getting data is more or less the same as in Prompt 1, so I won't repeat the code here. The only thing I did differently was collapse the 2-year and Bachelor's degrees into one \"college\" category and collapsed Master's and PhD into one post-bacc group.\n\nFor this chart I want to see if there are differences in highest educational attainment level by age group in two distinct years. Instead of one chart with too many lines, essentially a spaghetti graph, I made four charts and used the [`patchwork`](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/) package (created by a [Dane!](https://www.data-imaginist.com/)) to facet out the individual charts into a (hopefully) coherent whole.\n\nKeep in mind that while of course many people will be represented in both 2005 and 2023, this is not a longitudinal study. It's a snapshot of the Danish population by age groups at two distinct points in time.\n\nWe have the data, and it's time to build the charts. But instead of copy-pasting the ggplot code to build each charts, let's create a function and use that four times.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .code-overflow-scroll  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show code for the chart function\"}\nslope_graph <- function(plotdf) {\n\tplotdf %>%\n\tggplot(aes(x = year, y = age_ed_pct, group = age_group, color = age_group)) +\n\t\tgeom_line(size = 1) +\n\t\tgeom_point(size = .2) +\n\t\tscale_x_continuous(breaks = c(2005, 2023),\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t labels = c(\"2005\", \"2023\")) +\n\t\tscale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, .5),\n\t\t\tlabels = scales::label_percent()) +\n\t\tscale_color_brewer(palette = \"Set2\") +\n\t\tlabs(x = \"\", y = \"\") +\n\t\ttheme_minimal() +\n\t\ttheme(legend.position = \"bottom\", legend.spacing.x = unit(0, 'cm'),\n\t\t\t\t\tlegend.key.width = unit(3, 'cm'), legend.margin=margin(-10, 0, 0, 0),\n\t\t\t\t\tlegend.text = element_text(size = 10), legend.title = element_text(size = 12),\n\t\t\t\t\tplot.title = element_text(hjust = .5, size = 16),\n\t\t\t\t\tplot.subtitle = element_markdown(size = 14, vjust = -.5),\n\t\t\t\t\tplot.caption = element_markdown(size = 12, face = \"italic\"),\n\t\t\t\t\taxis.text.x = element_text(size = 11),\n\t\t\t\t\taxis.text.y = element_text(size = 11),\n\t\t\t\t\tpanel.grid.major = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n\t\t\t\t\tstrip.background = element_blank()) +\n\t\tguides(color = guide_legend(label.position = \"bottom\", reverse = FALSE, direction = \"horizontal\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t nrow = 1,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t title = \"Age Group\", title.position = \"top\"))\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nNow let's put the function to use. We'll create four plots, then stitch them together. Each plot will have its own descriptive title and subtitle, and the final chart will have one as well. Notice that we're using the titles to tell a quick story or share an insight, not to dryly name what the chart is doing. The `ggtext` package gives us markdown enhancements for chart elements like the title and subtitle.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .code-overflow-scroll  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show code for making the final chart\"}\n# create individual plots with titles and annotations\nplot_grundsk <-\n\tedattain2 %>%\n\tfilter(ed_group2 == \"Grundskole/Primary\") %>%\n\tslope_graph() +\n\tlabs(title = \"Primary school (thru grade 10)\",\n\t\t\t subtitle = \"*In 2023 Danes of all ages were much less likely to have stopped their education at<br>primary school\n\t\t\t than they were in 2005.<br>*\")\n\nplot_hs <-\n\tedattain2 %>%\n\tfilter(ed_group2 == \"Secondary\") %>%\n\tslope_graph() +\n\tlabs(title = \"Gymnasium & Vocational (High School)\",\n\t\t\t subtitle = \"*From 2005 to 2023, there was a steep decline in the percentage of Danes<br>\n\t\t\t aged 25-49 who were finished with education at the high school level, especially<br>\n\t\t\t Danes under 40.

In 2005, more Danes, especially Danes 60+ years of age, had ended their education at primary level. By 2023 many more Danes were likely to have progressed beyond the primary level, and younger Danes especially were finishing Bachelor's degrees and earning Master's degrees.\n\nIt's been government policy to support furthering education levels via free tuition and living stipends. This is made possible by a democratic-socialism approach to the economy, with higher tax rates on some earners than you might see in the US or UK, but for those taxes you received and your kids get at least 4 years of college paid for, and a small living stipend to boot.\n\nIn the US public higher education affordability models vary from state to state. Some states try to keep cost-of-attendance low via more direct state support. But not all students get full rides, even with need-based aid. I am much more a fan of the socialized approach to college affordability. the data shows it works in terms of increasing overall educational attainment.\n",
