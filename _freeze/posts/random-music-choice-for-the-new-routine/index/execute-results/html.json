As of October 2023 I have over 2160 records and CDs...more than 900 vinyl albums (LP & EP), more than 1000 CD albums (LP & EP), 100+ 7\" singles plus music in other formats.\n\nAnd yes I had it shipped from San Francisco to Lyon, then Lyon to Copenhagen. Related, my wife is a patient and understanding woman.\n\nWe know about the paradox of choice, right? Why you can't choose something to watch from the thousands of things available on the streaming services to which you subscribe?\n\nYeah, same here.\n\nThis is a problem I want to solve even more now that I'll be home more often, as my contract at CIEE has ended and I'm spending time re-skilling and upskilling my data knowledge...getting reacquainted with r, learning some Python and Tableau, and hopefully posting more regularly here, all while looking for my next job *(hint-hint, if you need a data analyst/data scientist or know someone who does, let me know)*.\n\nI need things to listen to and sometimes I want to randomize the choice so I don't spend 10 minutes dithering about it and choosing one of the same 20 records I listen to by default.\n\nSo anyway, what does a data nerd do? Write a quick script to randomize the choice. It's fairly simple, and I have a couple of ground rules:\n\n-   What comes up must be played. If that means [Hüsker Dü *Land Speed Record*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_Speed_Record_(album)) at 8:30am, so be it. If that means [Wilco's *Sky Blue Sky*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Blue_Sky) in the afternoon when I need a pick-me-up, so be it.\n\n-   Once played, it can't be played again via the randomizer. This of course doesn't preclude playing it when I want to hear it.\n\nSo how does it work? Well, let's see the code...it's not genius-level but it does the trick.\n\nFirst we load the packages....\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# load packages\nlibrary(tidyverse) # to do tidyverse things\nlibrary(tidylog) # to get a log of what's happening to the data\nlibrary(janitor) # tools for data cleaning\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow we load the music library...\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# read in music library\nmusiclib <- readxl::read_excel(\"~/Documents/music catalogue.xlsx\") %>%\n\tclean_names() %>%\n\trename(format = format_vinyl_cd, type = type_lp_ep_7_single_12)\n#> rename: renamed 2 variables (type, format)\nglimpse(musiclib)\n#> Rows: 2,166\n#> Columns: 11\n#> $ artist        <chr> \"'Til Tuesday\", \"[The] Caseworker\", \"10,000 Maniacs\", \"1…\n#> $ title         <chr> \"Welcome Home\", \"These Weeks Should Be Remembered\", \"Bli…\n#> $ type          <chr> \"LP\", \"LP\", \"LP\", \"LP\", \"LP\", \"LP\", \"LP\", \"LP\", \"LP\", \"L…\n#> $ format        <chr> \"CD\", \"CD\", \"CD\", \"CD\", \"CD\", \"CD\", \"vinyl\", \"vinyl\", \"C…\n#> $ year_issue    <dbl> 1986, 2003, 1989, 1987, 1993, 1995, 2019, 1985, 1992, 19…\n#> $ year_original <dbl> NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, …\n#> $ label_1       <chr> \"Epic Records\", \"Manifesto Records\", \"Elektra Records\", …\n#> $ label_2       <chr> NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, \"Fifty Seven Records\", NA, NA, \"Poly…\n#> $ label_3       <chr> NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, …\n#> $ notes         <chr> NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, …\n#> $ added         <dttm> 2020-12-14, 2020-05-25, 2020-12-14, 2020-12-14, 2020-12…\n```\n:::\n\n\n...and here we load the exclusion list (it will get appended to later)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# input played list\nmusicplayed <- readxl::read_excel(\"~/Documents/musicplayed.xlsx\") %>%\n\tclean_names()\n#glimpse(musicplayed)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThen we merge with the library, filter out what's been played, and get something new to listen to. In this case I'm filtering to just get full LPs or EPs (no singles) and on vinyl or CD (I have some rando flexidiscs).\n\nAfter which I create a new df to output and append to the played list and overwrite the played list.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# merge with played file,\n# exclude played\n# if desired, filter on format (vinyl, CD, either) and type (LP, EP, etc)\n# output new music to play\n# select variables for output to played file\nplaywhat <- musiclib %>%\n\tmerge(musicplayed, by = c(\"artist\", \"title\", \"format\", \"type\"), all = T) %>%\n\tmutate(played = ifelse(is.na(played), 0, played)) %>%\n\tfilter(played == 0) %>%\n\tfilter(format %in% c(\"vinyl\", \"CD\")) %>%  \n\tfilter(type %in% c(\"LP\", \"EP\")) %>%\n\tsample_n(1) %>%\n\tselect(artist, title, format, type) %>%\n\tmutate(date_played = Sys.Date()) %>%\n\tmutate(played = 1)\n\nview(playwhat)\n\n# add new music played to what has been played\nplayed2 <- playwhat %>%\n\trbind(musicplayed)\n\n## output that to excel file\nwritexl::write_xlsx(played2, \"~/Documents/musicplayed.xlsx\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nBy some cosmic coincidence, I ran the program this morning to get something to listen to while writing this post, and what came up was *Searching for Ray* by Copenhagen band [El Ray](https://elray.bandcamp.com/). And I bought this album back in 2018 at [Rte 66](https://www.vinylworld.org/record-shop/route66-kobenhavn/), an amazing store here in Copenhagen.\n\nIt turned out to be the perfect music to listen to while getting this post together (and debugging some weird glitch where `quarto` couldn't locate `r`)...I listened to it twice.\n\n![](elray_searchingforray.jpeg){fig-align=\"left\" fig-alt=\"my vinyl and cds.\"}\n\nThey play fun surf-rock...check them out.\n\nSo that's it, the data nerd's way to get around the paradox of choice and work through the tons of music I have on hand.\n",
