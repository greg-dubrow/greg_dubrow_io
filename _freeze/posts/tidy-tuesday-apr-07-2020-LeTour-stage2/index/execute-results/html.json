(Stage 2, charts!)\"\nauthor: \"gregers kjerulf dubrow\"\ndate: '2020-12-04'\ncategories: [post, tidytuesday, rstats, ggplot, dataviz, data visualization, sports, cycling, tour de france]\nimage: \"Kraftwerk_Tour_De_France_Soundtracks_album_cover.png\"\n---\n\n\n### Back in the saddle for Stage 2 of the Tour de France data ride\n\n[Stage 1](https://www.gregdubrow.io/tidy-tuesday-apr-07-2020-LeTour-stage1/) ended up being all about wrangling and cleaning the [#TidyTuesday Tour de France data](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2020/2020-04-07). When I first dug into the data I wasn't sure what I wanted to visualize. It wasn't until I spent some time living with the data, seeing what was there and looking at the [#tidytuesday TdF submissions on Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23TidyTuesday%20tour%20de%20france&src=recent_search_click&f=live) so I didn't repeat what was done that I decided I wanted to look at results by stage, specifically the gaps between the winners of each stage and the times recorded for the next-best group and the last rider(s) across the line. [Charlie Gallagher](https://twitter.com/CharlieGallaghr) took a [similar approach](https://github.com/charlie-gallagher/tidy-tuesday/tree/master/tourdefrance) at the data, using overall race results for the GC riders. \n\nA quick but important aside - in the Tour, as in most (all?) UCI races, while each rider is accorded a place - 1, 2, 3, etc... - times are calculated by identifiable groups crossing the line. So let's say you are 2nd to 15th in the 1st group (of 15 total riders) that crosses with barely any daylight between riders; you each get the same time as the winner. But only 1 rider wins the stage. In any stage, there could be only 2 or 3 identifiable time groups, or there could be many groups. Depends on the stage type and other factors - crashes, where in the race the stage took place, etc...\n\nWhat this means for my project here is I needed to wrangle data so that I was able to identify two time groups apart from the winner; the next best group and the last group. Each group could have more than 1 rider. Download and clean the stage results data and you'll see what I mean.\n\nSo let's look at some code and charts. \n\nAt the end of Stage 1 we had a number of data frames. I'm joining two for this analysis, one with stage winners (which has important stage characteristic data) and a set of all riders in every stage from 1903 to 2019. We'll first load the packages we need...\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# load packages\nlibrary(tidyverse) # to do tidyverse things\nlibrary(lubridate) # to do things with dates & times\nlibrary(tidylog) # to get a log of what's happening to the data\nlibrary(patchwork) # to stitch together plots\n\n# create notin operator to help with cleaning & analysis\n`%notin%` <- negate(`%in%`)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThen join the sets. For the purposes of this post I'll just load an RDS I created (_it's not uploaded to the repo, sorry, but you can recreate it with the [code](https://github.com/greg-dubrow/tidy-tuesday-projects/blob/master/2020/tt_2020-04-07_letour/tt_2020-04-07_letour.R)_.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntdf_stageall <- merge(tdf_stagedata, tdf_stagewin, by.x = c(\"race_year\", \"stage_results_id\"),\n                      by.y = c(\"race_year\", \"stage_results_id\"), all = T)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntdf_stageall <- readRDS(\"data/tdf_stageall.rds\")\nglimpse(tdf_stageall)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nRows: 255,807\nColumns: 32\n$ race_year        <dbl> 1903, 1903, 1903, 1903, 1903, 1903, 1903, 1903, 1903,…\n$ stage_results_id <chr> \"stage-01\", \"stage-01\", \"stage-01\", \"stage-01\", \"stag…\n$ edition          <int> 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1,…\n$ split_stage.x    <chr> \"no\", \"no\", \"no\", \"no\", \"no\", \"no\", \"no\", \"no\", \"no\",…\n$ rider            <chr> \"Garin Maurice\", \"Pagie Émile\", \"Georget Léon\", \"Auge…\n$ rider_first      <chr> \"Maurice\", \"Émile\", \"Léon\", \"Fernand\", \"Jean\", \"Marce…\n$ rider_last       <chr> \"Garin\", \"Pagie\", \"Georget\", \"Augereau\", \"Fischer\", \"…\n$ rider_firstlast  <chr> \"Maurice Garin\", \"Émile Pagie\", \"Léon Georget\", \"Fern…\n$ rank2            <chr> \"001\", \"002\", \"003\", \"004\", \"005\", \"006\", \"007\", \"008…\n$ time             <Period> 17H 45M 13S, 55S, 34M 59S, 1H 2M 48S, 1H 4M 53S, 1…\n$ elapsed          <Period> 17H 45M 13S, 17H 46M 8S, 18H 20M 12S, 18H 48M 1S, …\n$ points           <int> 100, 70, 50, 40, 32, 26, 22, 18, 14, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2, …\n$ bib_number       <int> NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, N…\n$ team             <chr> NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, N…\n$ age              <int> 32, 32, 23, 20, 36, 37, 25, 33, NA, 22, 26, 28, 21, 2…\n$ rank             <chr> \"1\", \"2\", \"3\", \"4\", \"5\", \"6\", \"7\", \"8\", \"9\", \"10\", \"1…\n$ stage_num.x      <chr> \"01\", \"01\", \"01\", \"01\", \"01\", \"01\", \"01\", \"01\", \"01\",…\n$ stage_ltr.x      <chr> \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"…\n$ stage_date       <date> 1903-07-01, 1903-07-01, 1903-07-01, 1903-07-01, 1903…\n$ stage_type       <chr> \"Flat / Plain / Hilly\", \"Flat / Plain / Hilly\", \"Flat…\n$ Type             <chr> \"Plain stage\", \"Plain stage\", \"Plain stage\", \"Plain s…\n$ split_stage.y    <chr> \"no\", \"no\", \"no\", \"no\", \"no\", \"no\", \"no\", \"no\", \"no\",…\n$ Origin           <chr> \"Paris\", \"Paris\", \"Paris\", \"Paris\", \"Paris\", \"Paris\",…\n$ Destination      <chr> \"Lyon\", \"Lyon\", \"Lyon\", \"Lyon\", \"Lyon\", \"Lyon\", \"Lyon…\n$ Distance         <dbl> 467, 467, 467, 467, 467, 467, 467, 467, 467, 467, 467…\n$ Winner           <chr> \"Maurice Garin\", \"Maurice Garin\", \"Maurice Garin\", \"M…\n$ winner_first     <chr> \"Maurice\", \"Maurice\", \"Maurice\", \"Maurice\", \"Maurice\"…\n$ winner_last      <chr> \"Garin\", \"Garin\", \"Garin\", \"Garin\", \"Garin\", \"Garin\",…\n$ Winner_Country   <chr> \"FRA\", \"FRA\", \"FRA\", \"FRA\", \"FRA\", \"FRA\", \"FRA\", \"FRA…\n$ Stage            <chr> \"1\", \"1\", \"1\", \"1\", \"1\", \"1\", \"1\", \"1\", \"1\", \"1\", \"1\"…\n$ stage_ltr.y      <chr> \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"…\n$ stage_num.y      <chr> \"01\", \"01\", \"01\", \"01\", \"01\", \"01\", \"01\", \"01\", \"01\",…\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis set has many columns that we'll build off of to use in analysis going forward. To get the changes in gaps by stage types, we'll build another set. Because we want to look both at changes in stage types and gaps between winners and the field, the trick here is to sort out for each stage in each race year who the winners are (easy), who has the slowest time (mostly easy) and who has the 2nd best record time.\n\nThat last item it tough because of the time & rank method I described above. The script below is commented to show why I did what I did. Much of the code comes from looking at the data and seeing errors, issues, etc. Not including that code here. Also, much of my ability to spot errors comes from knowledge about the race, how it's timed, some history. Domain knowledge helps a lot when cleaning & analyzing data.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nstage_gap <-\ntdf_stageall %>%\n  arrange(race_year, stage_results_id, rank2) %>%\n  #  delete 1995 stage 16 - neutralized due to death in stage 15, all times the same\n  mutate(out = ifelse((race_year == 1995 & stage_results_id == \"stage-16\"),\n                       \"drop\", \"keep\")) %>%\n  filter(out != \"drop\") %>%\n  # delete  missing times\n  filter(!is.na(time)) %>%\n  # remove non-finishers/starters, change outside time limit rank to numeric to keep in set\n  filter(rank %notin% c(\"DF\", \"DNF\", \"DNS\", \"DSQ\", \"NQ\")) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(rank)) %>%\n\n  # OTLs are ejected from the race because they finished outside a time limit.

First a chart to show averages and quartile ranges for the gaps by stage type. Create a data object with the values, then the plots. Faceting by stage type didn't work because the y axis ranges were very different. So we'll use `patchwork` to stitch them together in one plot. The medians are the red dots, interquartile ranges at either end of the line, and means are in black. I included both means & medians because the spread for some stage types was so great.\n\n\n::: {.cell fig.dpi='300'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show stage gap charts code\"}\ngapranges <- stage_gap %>%\n  filter(compare_grp != \"Winner\") %>%\n  filter(stage_type %notin% c(\"Other\", \"Time Trial - Team\")) %>%\n  group_by(stage_type, compare_grp) %>%\n  summarise(num = n(), \n            lq = quantile(time_diff_secs, 0.25),\n            medgap = median(time_diff_secs),\n            uq = quantile(time_diff_secs, 0.75),\n            lq_tp = (seconds_to_period(quantile(time_diff_secs, 0.25))),\n            medgap_tp = (seconds_to_period(median(time_diff_secs))),\n            uq_tp = (seconds_to_period(quantile(time_diff_secs, 0.75))),\n            avggap = round(mean(time_diff_secs),2),\n            avggap_tp = round(seconds_to_period(mean(time_diff_secs)), 2))\n\ngapplot1 <-\ngapranges %>%\n  filter(compare_grp == \"Next best\") %>%\n  ggplot(aes(stage_type, medgap, color = avggap)) +\n  geom_linerange(aes(ymin = lq, ymax = uq), size = 2, color = \"#0055A4\") +\n  geom_point(size = 2, color = \"#EF4135\") +\n  geom_point(aes(y = avggap), size = 2, color = \"black\", alpha = .8) +\n  geom_text(aes(label = medgap_tp), \n            size = 3, color = \"#EF4135\", hjust = 1.2) +\n  geom_text(aes(y = uq, label = uq_tp), \n            size = 3, color = \"#0055A4\", hjust = 1.2) +\n  geom_text(aes(y = lq, label = lq_tp), \n            size = 3, color = \"#0055A4\", hjust = 1.2) +\n  geom_text(aes(label = avggap_tp, y = avggap_tp),\n            size = 3, color = \"black\", alpha = .8, hjust = -.1) +\n  labs(title = \"Time Gap from Stage Winner to Next Best Time\",\n       subtitle = \"Median & Inter-quartile Ranges (avg in black)\",\n       y = \"Time Gap from Winner\", x = \"Stage Type\") +\n  theme_light() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(color = \"#0055A4\", size = 9),\n        plot.subtitle = element_text(face = \"italic\", color = \"#EF4135\",\n                                     size = 8),\n        axis.title.x = element_text(color = \"#0055A4\"),\n        axis.title.y = element_text(color = \"#0055A4\"), \n        axis.text.x = element_text(color = \"#0055A4\"),\n        axis.text.y=element_blank())\n\ngapplot2 <-\ngapranges %>%\n  filter(compare_grp == \"Last\") %>%\n  ggplot(aes(stage_type, medgap, color = avggap)) +\n  geom_linerange(aes(ymin = lq, ymax = uq), size = 2, color = \"#0055A4\") +\n  geom_point(size = 2, color = \"#EF4135\") +\n  geom_point(aes(y = avggap), size = 2, color = \"black\", alpha = .8) +\n  geom_text(aes(label = medgap_tp), \n            size = 3, color = \"#EF4135\", hjust = 1.2) +\n  geom_text(aes(y = uq, label = uq_tp), \n            size = 3, color = \"#0055A4\", hjust = 1.2) +\n  geom_text(aes(y = lq, label = lq_tp), \n            size = 3, color = \"#0055A4\", hjust = 1.1) +\n  geom_text(aes(label = avggap_tp, y = avggap_tp),\n            size = 3, color = \"black\", alpha = .8, hjust = -.1) +\n  labs(title = \"Time Gap from Stage Winner to Slowest Time\",\n       subtitle = \"Median & Inter-quartile Ranges (avg in black)\",\n       y = \"\", x = \"Stage Type\") +\n  theme_light() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(color = \"#0055A4\", size = 9),\n        plot.subtitle = element_text(face = \"italic\", color = \"#EF4135\",\n                                     size = 8),\n        axis.title.x = element_text(color = \"#0055A4\", size = 9),\n        axis.text.x = element_text(color = \"#0055A4\", size = 9),\n        axis.text.y=element_blank())\n\ngapplot1 + gapplot2 +\n  plot_annotation(title = \"Tour de France Stages, 1903 to 2019\",\n                  theme = theme(plot.title = \n                                  element_text(color = \"#0055A4\", size = 10)))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/tt_letour1b-1.png){width=720}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhat do these charts tell us? Well unsurprisingly mountain stages tend to have longer gaps between winners and the rest of the field than do flat/plain/hilly stages. Time trials are usually on flat or hilly stages, so they behave more like all other flat/plain/hilly stages. Even looking at the median to smooth for outliers, half of the last men in on mountain stages came in under 36 minutes, half over 36 minutes. The last 25% of mountain-stage riders came in an hour or more after the winner.\n\nHow has this changed over time? Well let's facet out by degree decade. \n\nFirst thing that needs doing is to build a dataframe for analysis - it will have medians my race year and stage type. But for the chart we want to have a decade field. Turns out this was a bit complicated in order to get the chart I wanted. You can see in the code comments why I did what I did.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show df build code\"}\ngaprangesyrdec <- \nstage_gap %>%\n  filter(compare_grp != \"Winner\") %>%\n  filter(stage_type %notin% c(\"Other\", \"Time Trial - Team\")) %>%\n  group_by(stage_type, compare_grp, race_year) %>%\n  summarise(num = n(), \n            lq = quantile(time_diff_secs, 0.25),\n            medgap = median(time_diff_secs),\n            uq = quantile(time_diff_secs, 0.75),\n            lq_tp = (seconds_to_period(quantile(time_diff_secs, 0.25))),\n            medgap_tp = (seconds_to_period(median(time_diff_secs))),\n            uq_tp = (seconds_to_period(quantile(time_diff_secs, 0.75))),\n            avggap = round(mean(time_diff_secs),2),\n            avggap_tp = round(seconds_to_period(mean(time_diff_secs)), 2)) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  # need to hard code in rows so x axis & faceting works in by decade charts\n  add_row(stage_type = \"Flat / Plain / Hilly\",\tcompare_grp = \"Next best\",\n          race_year = 1915, .before = 13) %>%\n  add_row(stage_type = \"Flat / Plain / Hilly\",\tcompare_grp = \"Next best\",\n          race_year = 1916, .before = 14) %>%\n  add_row(stage_type = \"Flat / Plain / Hilly\",\tcompare_grp = \"Next best\",\n          race_year = 1917, .before = 15) %>%\n  add_row(stage_type = \"Flat / Plain / Hilly\",\tcompare_grp = \"Next best\",\n          race_year = 1918, .before = 16) %>%\n  add_row(stage_type = \"Flat / Plain / Hilly\",\tcompare_grp = \"Last\",\n          race_year = 1915, .before = 123) %>%\n  add_row(stage_type = \"Flat / Plain / Hilly\",\tcompare_grp = \"Last\",\n          race_year = 1916, .before = 124) %>%\n  add_row(stage_type = \"Flat / Plain / Hilly\",\tcompare_grp = \"Last\",\n          race_year = 1917, .before = 125) %>%\n  add_row(stage_type = \"Flat / Plain / Hilly\",\tcompare_grp = \"Last\",\n          race_year = 1918, .before = 126) %>%\n  add_row(stage_type = \"Mountain\",\tcompare_grp = \"Next best\",\n          race_year = 1915, .before = 233) %>%\n  add_row(stage_type = \"Mountain\",\tcompare_grp = \"Next best\",\n          race_year = 1916, .before = 234) %>%\n  add_row(stage_type = \"Mountain\",\tcompare_grp = \"Next best\",\n          race_year = 1917, .before = 235) %>%\n  add_row(stage_type = \"Mountain\",\tcompare_grp = \"Next best\",\n          race_year = 1918, .before = 236) %>%\n  add_row(stage_type = \"Mountain\",\tcompare_grp = \"Last\",\n          race_year = 1915, .before = 343) %>%\n  add_row(stage_type = \"Mountain\",\tcompare_grp = \"Last\",\n          race_year = 1916, .before = 344) %>%\n  add_row(stage_type = \"Mountain\",\tcompare_grp = \"Last\",\n          race_year = 1917, .before = 345) %>%\n  add_row(stage_type = \"Mountain\",\tcompare_grp = \"Last\",\n          race_year = 1918, .before = 346) %>%\n\n    # need field for x axis when faciting by decade\n  mutate(year_n = str_sub(race_year,4,4)) %>%\n  # create race decade field\n  mutate(race_decade = floor(race_year / 10) * 10) %>%\n  mutate(race_decade = as.character(paste0(race_decade, \"s\"))) %>%\n#  mutate(race_decade = ifelse(race_year %in%))\n  arrange(stage_type, compare_grp, race_year) %>%\n  select(stage_type, compare_grp, race_year, year_n, race_decade, everything())\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow that we have a dataframe to work from, let's make a chart. But to do that we have to make a few charts and then put them together with the [`patchwork`](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/) package.\n\nFirst up is changes in the mountain stages and the median gaps between winner and next best recorded time. I grouped into three decade sets. Note that because of changes in the gaps over time, the y axes are a bit different in the early decades of the race. Also note at how I was able to get hours:seconds:minutes to show up on the y axis. The x axis digits are that way because race year would repeat in each facet, so I had to create a proxy year.\n\n\n::: {.cell fig.dpi='300'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show mountain stage gap charts code\"}\n# mountain winner to next best\nplot_dec_mtnb1 <-\ngaprangesyrdec %>%\n  filter(compare_grp == \"Next best\") %>%\n  filter(stage_type == \"Mountain\") %>%\n  filter(race_decade %in% c(\"1900s\", \"1910s\", \"1920s\", \"1930s\")) %>%\n#  filter(race_decade %in% c(\"1940s\", \"1950s\", \"1960s\", \"1970s\")) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(year_n, medgap)) +\n  geom_line(group = 1, color = \"#EF4135\") +\n  geom_point(data = subset(gaprangesyrdec, \n                           (race_year == 1919 & stage_type == \"Mountain\" & \n                              compare_grp == \"Next best\" & year_n == \"9\")), \n             aes(x = year_n, y = medgap), color = \"#EF4135\") +\n  scale_y_time(labels = waiver()) +\n  labs(x = \"Year\", y = \"H:Min:Sec\") + \n  facet_grid( ~ race_decade) +\n  theme_light() +\n  theme(axis.title.x = element_text(color = \"#0055A4\", size = 8),\n        axis.title.y = element_text(color = \"#0055A4\" , size = 8),\n        axis.text.x = element_text(color = \"#0055A4\", size = 8),\n        axis.text.y = element_text(color = \"#0055A4\", size = 7),\n        strip.background = element_rect(fill = \"#0055A4\"), strip.text.x = element_text(size = 8))\n\nplot_dec_mtnb2 <-\ngaprangesyrdec %>%\n  filter(compare_grp == \"Next best\") %>%\n  filter(stage_type == \"Mountain\") %>%\n  filter(race_decade %in% c(\"1940s\", \"1950s\", \"1960s\", \"1970s\")) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(year_n, medgap)) +\n  geom_line(group = 1, color = \"#EF4135\") +\n  scale_y_time(limits = c(0, 420), labels = waiver()) +\n  labs(x = \"Year\", y = \"H:Min:Sec\") + \n  facet_grid( ~ race_decade) +\n  theme_light() +\n  theme(axis.title.x = element_text(color = \"#0055A4\", size = 8),\n        axis.title.y = element_text(color = \"#0055A4\" , size = 8),\n        axis.text.x = element_text(color = \"#0055A4\", size = 8),\n        axis.text.y = element_text(color = \"#0055A4\", size = 7),\n        strip.background = element_rect(fill = \"#0055A4\"), strip.text.x = element_text(size = 8))\n\nplot_dec_mtnb3 <-\ngaprangesyrdec %>%\n  filter(compare_grp == \"Next best\") %>%\n  filter(stage_type == \"Mountain\") %>%\n  filter(race_decade %in% c(\"1980s\", \"1990s\", \"2000s\", \"2010s\")) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(year_n, medgap)) +\n  geom_line(group = 1, color = \"#EF4135\") +\n  scale_y_time(limits = c(0, 420), labels = waiver()) +\n  labs(x = \"Year\", y = \"H:Min:Sec\") + \n  facet_grid( ~ race_decade) +\n  theme_light() +\n  theme(axis.title.x = element_text(color = \"#0055A4\", size = 8),\n        axis.title.y = element_text(color = \"#0055A4\" , size = 8),\n        axis.text.x = element_text(color = \"#0055A4\", size = 8),\n        axis.text.y = element_text(color = \"#0055A4\", size = 7),\n        strip.background = element_rect(fill = \"#0055A4\"), strip.text.x = element_text(size = 8))\n\nplot_dec_mtnb1 / plot_dec_mtnb2 / plot_dec_mtnb3 +\n  plot_annotation(title = \"Gaps Between Winner & Next Best Times are Narrowing\",\n                  subtitle = \"Median gap on mountain stages, by year & decade; no race during world wars\",\n                  theme = \n                    theme(plot.title = element_text(color = \"#0055A4\", size = 10),\n                          plot.subtitle = element_text(color = \"#EF4135\", \n                                                       face = \"italic\", size = 9)))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/tt_letour2b-1.png){width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhat does this chart tell us? As you look at it, keep in mind the y axis is different in the 1900s - 1930s chart because in the early years of the race the gaps were much wider. \n\nMost obviously, and not surprisingly, the gaps between winner and next best time shrank as the race professionalized and sports science got better. There are of course outliers here and there in the last few decades, but the course changes year-to-year, and some years the race organizers have made some years more difficult than other in the mountains.\n\nWe also see the effect of war. The two world wars not only interrupted the race in those years, but especially in the years immediately after WWII the gaps were larger than in the late 1930s. We can imagine what the war did to the pool of riders. The sport needed time to recover, for riders to train and get back to full fitness. \n\nOk, now let's look at the changes in the mountains from the winners to the time for the last rider(s). The only change from the last set of charts is `filter(compare_grp == \"Last\")`\n\n\n::: {.cell fig.dpi='300'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show mountain stage gap charts code\"}\n# mountain winner to last\nplot_dec_mtla1 <-\n  gaprangesyrdec %>%\n  filter(compare_grp == \"Last\") %>%\n  filter(stage_type == \"Mountain\") %>%\n  filter(race_decade %in% c(\"1900s\", \"1910s\", \"1920s\", \"1930s\")) %>%\n  #  filter(race_decade %in% c(\"1940s\", \"1950s\", \"1960s\", \"1970s\")) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(year_n, medgap)) +\n  geom_line(group = 1, color = \"#EF4135\") +\n  geom_point(data = subset(gaprangesyrdec, \n                           (race_year == 1919 & stage_type == \"Last\" & \n                              compare_grp == \"Next best\" & year_n == \"9\")), \n             aes(x = year_n, y = medgap), color = \"#EF4135\") +\n  scale_y_time(labels = waiver()) +\n  labs(x = \"Year\", y = \"H:Min:Sec\") + \n  facet_grid( ~ race_decade) +\n  theme_light() +\n  theme(axis.title.x = element_text(color = \"#0055A4\", size = 8),\n        axis.title.y = element_text(color = \"#0055A4\", size = 7),\n        axis.text.x = element_text(color = \"#0055A4\", size = 8),\n        axis.text.y = element_text(color = \"#0055A4\", size = 7),\n        strip.background = element_rect(fill = \"#0055A4\"), strip.text.x = element_text(size = 8))\n\nplot_dec_mtla2 <-\n  gaprangesyrdec %>%\n  filter(compare_grp == \"Last\") %>%\n  filter(stage_type == \"Mountain\") %>%\n  filter(race_decade %in% c(\"1940s\", \"1950s\", \"1960s\", \"1970s\")) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(year_n, medgap)) +\n  geom_line(group = 1, color = \"#EF4135\") +\n  scale_y_time(limits = c(0, 5400), labels = waiver()) +\n  labs(x = \"Year\", y = \"H:Min:Sec\") + \n  facet_grid( ~ race_decade) +\n  theme_light() +\n  theme(axis.title.x = element_text(color = \"#0055A4\", size = 8),\n        axis.title.y = element_text(color = \"#0055A4\", size = 7),\n        axis.text.x = element_text(color = \"#0055A4\", size = 8),\n        axis.text.y = element_text(color = \"#0055A4\", size = 7),\n        strip.background = element_rect(fill = \"#0055A4\"), strip.text.x = element_text(size = 8))\n\nplot_dec_mtla3 <-\n  gaprangesyrdec %>%\n  filter(compare_grp == \"Last\") %>%\n  filter(stage_type == \"Mountain\") %>%\n  filter(race_decade %in% c(\"1980s\", \"1990s\", \"2000s\", \"2010s\")) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(year_n, medgap)) +\n  geom_line(group = 1, color = \"#EF4135\") +\n  scale_y_time(limits = c(0, 5400), labels = waiver()) +\n  labs(x = \"Year\", y = \"H:Min:Sec\") + \n  facet_grid( ~ race_decade) +\n  theme_light() +\n  theme(axis.title.x = element_text(color = \"#0055A4\", size = 8),\n        axis.title.y = element_text(color = \"#0055A4\", size = 7),\n        axis.text.x = element_text(color = \"#0055A4\", size = 8),\n        axis.text.y = element_text(color = \"#0055A4\", size = 7),\n        strip.background = element_rect(fill = \"#0055A4\"), strip.text.x = element_text(size = 8))\n\nplot_dec_mtla1 / plot_dec_mtla2 / plot_dec_mtla3  +\n  plot_annotation(title = \"Gaps Between Winner & Last Rider Times Mostly Stable Since 1950s\",\n                  subtitle = \"Median gap on mountain stages, by year & decade; no race during world wars\",\n                  theme = \n                    theme(plot.title = element_text(color = \"#0055A4\", size = 10),\n                          plot.subtitle = element_text(color = \"#EF4135\", \n                                                       face = \"italic\", size = 9)))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/tt_letour2c-1.png){width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhat do we see here?

But in the early years of the race, the last man in sometimes wouldn't arrive until 10+ hours after the winner!\n\nBut since then the gaps are mostly around 30+ minutes.

The sprinters tend to suffer in the Alps, Pyrenees and other mountain stages. As long as they come in under the time threshold, they are likely to be well behind on the day. But on flat stages, the only thing that keeps a rider more than a few minutes back is a spill, flat tire, or just having a bad day. \n\nNow it's worth noting that I did not normalize for stage distance or elevation gain (for mountain stages) in terms of comparing year to year. I went with the assumption that since I was grouping multiple stages into a year, that even over time this would normalize itself. If this were a more serious analysis I'd do it. \n\nAnother extension of this analysis would be a model to predict time gaps. Then I'd include stage distance & gain, rider height/weight, and other factors. \n\nSome shout-outs are in order. First of course to the #tidytuesday crew.
