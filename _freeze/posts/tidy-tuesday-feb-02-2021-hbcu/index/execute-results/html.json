It was a great first Tidy Tuesday set for Black History Month. To keep this from being a journal-length piece, I won't put on my history of higher ed teacher hat & get into how HBCUs came to be. Here's a [good overview](https://hbcufirst.com/hbcu-history-timeline).\n\nOne of my strengths as a data analyst is a brain that's constantly asking questions of a dataset:\n\n\\* what's in there?\n\n\\* what relationships exist between variables?\n\n\\* what I can add to the dataset to glean more insight?\n\nFor Tidy Tuesday though that slows things down -- it's mostly meant to be a quick turnaround thing where you share results to Twitter. So my deep-dive habits mean I'm usually a bit behind getting Tidy Tuesday analysis done the week the data are posted. My goal for this analysis is to show:\n\n\\* changes over time in the racial and gender make-up of students at HBCUs\n\n\\* changes over time in overall enrollment at HBCUs by sector (public 4yr, private 4y, etc), relative to non-HBCUs\n\n\\* changes over time in tuition & fees by sector, HBCUs vs non-HBCUs\n\nThe Tidy Tuesday data has some of what I need - it comes from [Data.World](https://data.world/nces/hbcu-fall-enrollment-1976-2015) via [IPEDS](https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/) (essentially the US Department of Education's higher ed data library) . I'm supplementing it with data from the [Delta Cost Project](https://deltacostproject.org/delta-cost-project-database), which aggrgated years worth of data from IPEDS.\n\nSo let's dive into the data. \n\n\n\n\n\nFirst we load the packages we'll be using...\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# load packages\nlibrary(tidytuesdayR) # load the tidy tuesday data\nlibrary(tidyverse) # to do tidyverse things\nlibrary(tidylog) # to get a log of what's happening to the data\nlibrary(janitor) # tools for data cleaning\nlibrary(patchwork) # to stitch together plots\nlibrary(ggtext) # helper functions for ggplot\nlibrary(ggrepel) # helper functions for ggplot\n```\n:::\n\n\n...then lets make a couple of things we'll use a lot going forward.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# create notin operator to help with cleaning & analysis\n`%notin%` <- negate(`%in%`)\n\n# function for year-over-year percent changes\npctchange <- function(x) {\n  (x - lag(x)) / lag(x)\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow we'll load the sets from TidyTuesday and then the Delta Cost Project files.\n\nI'll load the Tidy Tuesday data objects via the `tidytuesdayR` package and clean up the data. This week's data came in a few separate files. For my analysis I need a dataframe of HBCU enrollments with Black and non-Black students. So I need to combine the two HBCU enrollment files (one each for Black students and all students) into one and subtract Black from All to get non-Black. I'll show code for loading the Black student set in, cleaning it up a bit, and skip to the subtraction & joins. For the full code experience, head to [my Tidy Tuesday repo](https://github.com/greg-dubrow/tidy-tuesday-projects/tree/master/2021/tt_2021-02-02_hbcu)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"show tt_hbcu_black data load & cleaning code\"}\ntt_hbcu_load <- tt_load(\"2021-02-02\")\n\ntt_hbcu_black <- as_tibble(tt_hbcu_load$hbcu_black) %>%\n  clean_names() %>%\n  mutate(year = as.character(year)) %>%\n  mutate(ethnicity = \"Black\") %>%\n  select(year, ethnicity, enroll_n = total_enrollment, women = females, men = males, \n         four_year_all = x4_year, two_year_all = x2_year,\n         total_public, four_year_pub = x4_year_public, two_year_pub = x2_year_public, \n         total_private, four_year_pri = x4_year_private, two_year_pri = x2_year_private) \n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"show tt_hbcu_all data load & cleaning code\"}\ntt_hbcu_all <- as_tibble(tt_hbcu_load$hbcu_all) %>%\n  clean_names() %>%\n  mutate(ethnicity = \"All\") %>%\n  mutate(year = as.character(year)) %>%\n  select(year, ethnicity, enroll_n = total_enrollment, women = females, men = males, \n         four_year_all = x4_year, two_year_all = x2_year,\n         total_public, four_year_pub = x4_year_public, two_year_pub = x2_year_public, \n         total_private, four_year_pri = x4_year_private, two_year_pri = x2_year_private)  \n```\n:::\n\n\nLet's join `tt_hbcu_black` with `tt_hbcu_all` and create the non-Black ethnicity group.

The final dataframes I'll use for plots are  `tt_hbcu_enr_eth_sex` & `tt_hbcu_enr_eth_sect`. Because of the way the source data was arrayed I could do ethnicty by gender and ethnicity by sector but not all three vectors.

There's a ton of data in the set, but all I want for this analysis is enrollments and tuition - I'll pull those fields from each set, then rbind together into a dataframe called `tuitenr_8715_agg` for year-over-year by-sector analysis. Unfortunately while DCP has enrollment by ethnicity, they only do it for total enrollment - grad and undergrad combined - so I can't do some of the HBCU vs non-HBCU comparisons. There are other sources which I'll describe at the end of the post. \n\nOk, loading the 2000 to 2015 data...\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"show DCP 2000 - 2015 load code\"}\ndelta0015all <- (haven::read_sas(\"~/Data/ipeds/delta_public_release_00_15.sas7bdat\", NULL))\ndelta0015_tuitenr <- delta0015all %>%\n  filter(between(sector_revised, 1, 6)) %>%\n  mutate(sector_desc = case_when(sector_revised == 1 ~\t\"Public 4yr\",\n                                 sector_revised == 2\t~ \"Private nonprofit 4yr\",\n                                 sector_revised == 3\t~ \"Private for-profit 4yr\",\n                                 sector_revised == 4\t~ \"Public 2yr\",\n                                 sector_revised == 5\t~ \"Private nonprofit 2yr\",\n                                 sector_revised == 6\t~ \"Private for-profit 2yr\")) %>%\n # mutate(total_undergraduates = ifelse(is.na(total_undergraduates), 0, total_undergraduates)) %>%\n  select(unitid, instname, sector_revised, sector_desc, hbcu,\n         year = academicyear, tuition_fee_ug_in = tuitionfee02_tf, \n         tuition_fee_ug_oos = tuitionfee03_tf, \n         total_undergraduates)\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow let's load the 1987 to 1999 data...\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"show DCP 1987 - 1999 load code\"}\ndelta8799all <- (haven::read_sas(\"~/Data/ipeds/delta_public_release_87_99.sas7bdat\", NULL))\n\ndelta8799_tuitenr <- as_tibble(delta8799all) %>%\n  filter(between(sector_revised, 1, 6)) %>%\n  mutate(sector_desc = case_when(sector_revised == 1 ~\t\"Public 4yr\",\n                                 sector_revised == 2\t~ \"Private nonprofit 4yr\",\n                                 sector_revised == 3\t~ \"Private for-profit 4yr\",\n                                 sector_revised == 4\t~ \"Public 2yr\",\n                                 sector_revised == 5\t~ \"Private nonprofit 2yr\",\n                                 sector_revised == 6\t~ \"Private for-profit 2yr\")) %>%\n # mutate(total_undergraduates = ifelse(is.na(total_undergraduates), 0, total_undergraduates)) %>%\n  select(unitid, instname, sector_revised, sector_desc, hbcu,\n         year = academicyear, tuition_fee_ug_in = tuitionfee02_tf, \n         tuition_fee_ug_oos = tuitionfee03_tf, \n         total_undergraduates)\n```\n:::\n\n\n...and let's join and munge the DCP files...\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"show DCP join & clean code\"}\ntuitenr_8715 <- rbind(delta0015_tuitenr, delta8799_tuitenr)\n\ntuitenr_8715_agg <-\n  tuitenr_8715 %>%\n  # filter(!sector_desc == \"Private for-profit 2yr\" &\n  #          !sector_desc == \"Private for-profit 4yr\") %>%\n#  filter(!is.na(tuition_fee_ug_in)) %>%\n  group_by(year, sector_desc, hbcu) %>%\n  summarise(enr_tot = sum(total_undergraduates, na.rm = TRUE),\n            mean_tuit_in = mean(tuition_fee_ug_in, na.rm = TRUE),\n            mean_tuit_oos = mean(tuition_fee_ug_oos, na.rm = TRUE)\n            ) %>%\n  mutate(level = ifelse(str_detect(sector_desc, \"2yr\"), \"2yr\", \"4yr\")) %>%\n#  summarise(mean_tuit_in = mean(tuition_fee_ug_in, na.rm = T)) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  mutate(hbcu_f = ifelse(hbcu == 1, \"HBCU\", \"Not HBCU\")) %>%\n  mutate(hbcu_f = factor(hbcu_f, levels = c(\"HBCU\", \"Not HBCU\"))) \n```\n:::\n\n\nBecause I'll be doing some year-over-year percent change analysis, I'll create a separate dataframe from `tuitenr_8715_agg` (the DCP data) so I can compare HBCU to non-HBCU changes by year. \n\nRemember the `pctchange` function I created when I loaded the packages? Here it's put to good use. I'll only show code for one of the frames - I created frames for each sector, HBCU and non-HBCU. The final data set will rbind 10 frames into `tuit_8715_pctchgh`.

I'll fold the code for the more basic charts, click on the arrow to see it.  You'll note that this analysis is mostly line graphs. That'a because I'm mostly doing trend analysis, and I like line graphs for time series. \n\nFirst up we'll use the Tidy Tuesday data to look at HBCU enrollment by ethnicity (Black and non-Black) from 1990 to 2015. What do we see? Overall, periods of increase and decrease in total enrollment. But interestingly we see that non-Black enrollment kept increasing, even as Black enrollment started to drop. Of course Black students make up a vast majority of HBCU enrollment, so their trends drive overall numbers. It is worth noting though that the changes started in the 2010s, coinciding with [changes in how NCES counted ethncity](https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/report-your-data/race-ethnicity-reporting-changes). It's beyond the scope of this quick (ha) analysis, but worth digging deeper to see the effect of changes on the ethnic mix of HBCUs.\n\n\n::: {.cell fig.dpi='300'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"show the enrollment by ethnicity line charts code\"}\n## tt hbcu data, black men v women over time\ntt_hbcu_enr_eth_sex %>%\n  filter(year > 1989) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(year, enroll_n, group = 1)) +\n  geom_line(color = \"#E69F00\", size = 1) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma_format(), breaks = scales::pretty_breaks()) +\n  scale_x_discrete(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks()) +\n  facet_grid(ethnicity ~ ., scales = \"free_y\") +\n  labs(title = \"Black Enrollment at HBCUs Rising & Falling Since 1990\",\n       subtitle = \"Non-Black enrollment slowly & streadily increasing\",\n       caption = \"Source: Tidy Tuesday data\",\n       x = \"\", y = \"Total UG Enrollment\") +\n  theme_light() +\n  theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n        panel.background = element_blank(), strip.background = element_rect(fill = \"#E69F00\"),\n        plot.subtitle = element_text(color = \"#E69F00\", face = \"italic\", size = 9),\n        plot.caption = element_text(color = \"#999999\", face = \"italic\", size = 7))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](images/dataviz1-1.png){width=100%}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"show the enrollment by ethnicity line charts code\"}\n\ntt_hbcu_enr_eth_sex %>%\n  filter(year > 1989) %>%\n  filter(ethnicity == \"Black\") %>%\n  distinct(year, ethnicity, .keep_all = T) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(year, enroll_eth_pct, group = 1)) +\n  geom_line(color = \"#E69F00\", size = 1.25) +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(.5, 1), \n                     labels = scales::percent_format()) +\n  scale_x_discrete(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks()) +\n  labs(title = \"Slight Decrease Over Time in Percentage of Black Students Enrolled at HBCUs\",\n       subtitle = \"Might be due to changes in how ethnicity is coded by US Dept of Ed\",\n       caption = \"Source: Tidy Tuesday data\",\n       x = \"\", y = \"Pct Black students\") +\n  theme_light() +\n  theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n        panel.background = element_blank(), \n        plot.title = element_text(size = 11),\n        plot.subtitle = element_text(color = \"#E69F00\", face = \"italic\", size = 9),\n        plot.caption = element_text(color = \"#999999\", face = \"italic\", size = 7))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](images/dataviz1-2.png){width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNext let's look at enrollment by ethnicity & sex. HBCU enrollment mirrors that of higher ed enrollment in general - [since the early 1980s](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d19/tables/dt19_303.70.asp) women outnumber men. There are differences by sector (4-year, 2-year, public & private) and field of study but the oveall trend has been consistent. We do see that for non-Black students at HBCUs the percentage of women is a bit less than that of Black students. \n\n\n::: {.cell fig.dpi='300'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"show the enrollment by ethnicity & sex line charts code\"}\ntt_hbcu_enr_eth_sex %>%\n  filter(year > 1989) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(year, sex_n, group = 1)) +\n  geom_line(color = \"#E69F00\", size = 1) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma_format()) +\n  # scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 250000),\n  #                    breaks = c(0, 50000, 100000, 150000, 200000, 250000),\n  #                    labels = scales::comma_format()) +\n  scale_x_discrete(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks()) +\n  labs(title = \"Black Women Enroll in Higher Numbers Than Men at HBCUs\",\n       subtitle = \"Same Pattern as Overall Undergrad Enrollments in the US\",\n       caption = \"Source: Tidy Tuesday data\",\n       x = \"\", y = \"Total UG Enrollment\") +\n  facet_grid(ethnicity ~ sex, scales = \"free_y\") +\n  theme_light() +\n  theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n        panel.background = element_blank(), strip.background = element_rect(fill = \"#E69F00\"),\n        plot.subtitle = element_text(color = \"#E69F00\", face = \"italic\", size = 9),\n        plot.caption = element_text(color = \"#999999\", face = \"italic\", size = 7))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](images/dataviz2-1.png){width=100%}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"show the enrollment by ethnicity & sex line charts code\"}\n\n# sex - women as pct\ntt_hbcu_enr_eth_sex %>%\n  filter(year > 1989) %>%\n  filter(sex == \"women\") %>%\n  ggplot(aes(year, enroll_sex_pct, group = 1)) +\n  geom_line(color = \"#E69F00\", size = 1) +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(.5, .8), \n                     labels = scales::percent_format()) +\n  scale_x_discrete(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks()) +\n  labs(title = \"Women a Greater Percentage of those Enrolled at HBCUs\",\n       subtitle = \"Slightly higher among Black students than not Black\",\n       caption = \"Source: Tidy Tuesday data\",\n       x = \"\", y = \"Pct Women enrolled\") +\n  facet_grid(ethnicity ~ ., scales = \"free_y\") +\n  theme_light() +\n  theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n        panel.background = element_blank(), strip.background = element_rect(fill = \"#E69F00\"),\n        plot.subtitle = element_text(color = \"#E69F00\", face = \"italic\", size = 9),\n        plot.caption = element_text(color = \"#999999\", face = \"italic\", size = 7))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](images/dataviz2-2.png){width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe next thing I want to look at is enrollment by sector for HBCUs. In this case we think of sectors along two axes - public and private, and 2-year (community/junior colleges) vs 4-year (baccalaureate granting). What these first two sector charts show us is that most HBCU enrollment is in publics and in 4-year schools. Given the land-grant history of most HBCUs, that makes sense. \n\nI am leaving in the code for the first chart to highlight how one can a) have two different colored lines within the same chart in a faceted visualization (the `scale_color_manual` call) and b) use the amazing [`ggtext`](https://wilkelab.org/ggtext/) package to get two different colors of text in the subtitle line, so it does the work of a legend. The `<span style = </span>` and the `element_markdown` call in the `theme` specification is how you make it happen.\n\nThe third chart takes a slightly different view of the data, looking at percent of enrollment by sector within each of the ethnic categories we have in the data, Black and not-Black. What the first two charts showed is confirmed here - that Black students in HBCUs are mostly in public 4-years, and that trend has held steady since at least 1990.\n\n\n::: {.cell fig.dpi='300'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntt_hbcu_enr_eth_sect %>%\n  filter(year > 1989) %>%\n  filter(ethnicity %in% c(\"Black\", \"Not Black\")) %>%\n  filter(sector %in% c(\"total_private\", \"total_public\")) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(year, pct_sect_eth, group = sector, color = sector)) +\n  geom_line(size = 1) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"#56B4E9\", \"#E69F00\")) +\n  scale_x_discrete(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks()) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(),\n                     limits = c(0, 1), breaks = c(0, .25, .5, .75, 1)) +\n  labs(title = \"Public HBCUs Enroll Greater Pct of Students \",\n       subtitle = \"Greater Pct Black students in Private HBCU than non-Black students;

Just looking for general trends, what might be worth a deeper dive. Like with the percent changes in tuition or enrollment...what was happening in the years with the wider + or - swings? The 2001 recession? The 2009/10 economic collapse? Which specific schools had more success with enrollment? Which HBCUs are the most & least expensive?\n\nAnd what other questions one could answer with the data I used here? Well for one, the tuition discount rates by sectors and HBCU/not HBCU would be an interesting thing to look at. Did HBCUs need to more aggressively discount tution to meet enrollment targets? The Delta Cost Project set includes a tuition discount variable. There's a regression analysis in there somewhere, as well as other predictive analysis.\n\nI'd also want to look at which ethnic groups made up the growth in non-Black enrollments starting in 2010. Or was it that the changes to how ethnicity was recorded meant that students who used to be classified as Black become Hispanic or multi-ethnic. I know from my time in undergrad admissions at UC Berkeley that this accounted for a decline in the federal count of African-American students. However, when we compared the numbers with the UC definitions, we didn't see a decline. \n\nTo get those numbers I could download IPEDS data directly from NCES or use r tools like the [Urban Insitute's](https://www.urban.org/) [`educationdata` package](https://github.com/UrbanInstitute/education-data-package-r ) which is an API wrapper to that scrapes NCES and other websites for data.\n\nThere is a ton of higher education data out there, and it's never been easier to get at scale than now. Trust me, as someone who has done individual downloads, ordered CD-ROMs, even used the late-great [WebCASPAR](https://twitter.com/greg_dubrow/status/1146097408754909184), if you have an education policy or outcomes related question, there is publicly available data for analysis. \n\n*Cover image for post from [GWU CCAS Graduate Blog](https://blogs.gwu.edu/ccasgrad/2021/06/10/the-hbcu-legacy/)*\n\n*This post was last updated on 2023-05-18*\n",
