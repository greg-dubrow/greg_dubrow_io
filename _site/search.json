    "section": "",
    "text": "As I mentioned in the Migration and Resurrection post, some issues with my old Hugo build and Netlify playing nicely with Wowchemy led to me deciding to rebuild things in Quarto. I was thinking about it anyway, as Quarto seems robust and even more user-friendly than blogdown.\nThe basic idea of the blog remains the same - present the code & analysis for topics that interest me. I learned so much from reading tons of data blogs and watching how-to videos that I wanted to give back to the rstats community by showing and explaining my work. It also helps me as my own reference for code and approach to visualization when I forget how I did a pivot-long or cleaned and set-up data to work well with the visualization I wanted to do.\nI decided to set some ground rules for the old posts: * Minimal editing…only for typos and occasional clunky language.\n\nBut no editing the code. The projects I posted showed where I was in using r at the time. Though to be honest, if anything I’ve regressed a bit as I haven’t used r that much since I left my last data job. Besides, the rmarkdown -> quarto migration already entailed enough editing in the YAML and code chunk headers.\nRepost the projects with date-stamps from the original posting. I want this to still accurately document my own data analysis/data science progression, even with that long gap between posts.\n\nSo how did I do it?\nFirst I spent a couple of sunny weekend afternoons in May watching two presentations about Quarto.\nThis one from ___ 2022 where Thomas Mock presentated on Quarto basics\nAnd then Isabel Velsquez’s presentation on doing a blog with Quarto.\nI also read the extensive Quarto documentation\nI spent those sunny weekend afternoons redoing my old rmd files to qmd INSERT SIDE BY SIDE COMPARISONS OF YAML AND CODE CHUNKS FROM RMD & QMD and getting the basic design going. I’ll probably tweak the design now and then as I learn a bit more customization and functionality in Quarto and learn more CSS and other styling tools.\nAfter redoing a couple of old posts I pushed to github and hoped that Netlify would play nicely and render the new site.\nEt voila, here we are."

    "text": "Lots of things happening since last post in February 2021. The blog was set up during the early stages of COVID lockdown when all of a sudden I had more time on my hands.\nBut since that last post my wife and I made the decision to move to Europe in 2022 and started preparations for that. The world started to repoen a bit, my wife broke her ankle so all of a sudden I was doing lots of home health care on top of work.\nThen in April 2022 we moved. First stop was Lyon France where I earned a CELTA via the ELT Hub. INSERT LYON IMAGE HERE I had expected work to trickle in and I’d do independent data work while also spending time learning French and exploring Lyon and more of France. But teaching gigs came in abundance and free time was at a premium.\nThen in December 2022 we moved again. A job at CIEE in Denmark came up and we accelerated the ultimate end goal of moving here - back to where I was born and still have lots of family and friends. Now that we’re settled in our first non-sublet in almost a year and I’ve gotten settled at work, there’s finally some time to get my head back into data work. I was partly inspired by serving as a mentor in the DDSA mentoring program. I also started using r at work to automate a few mundane tasks and to do a little analysis on our students.\nI’ll write about the migration process in a bit more detail in another post, but the tl/dr as to why is because in trying to do a simple update to my old main picture (me in a mask, early in lockdown) the build was failing in Netlify. So rather than try and diagnose the Hugo/Wowchemy issues, I saw that Posit’s new Quarto tool is very robust and a bit easier to publish with, so I decided to just rebuild the entire site.\nTo read about the migration details, go here. All of the old posts are up, time-stamped with the original posting dates. And hopefully soon, new posts as I work through a fairly long list of project ideas."
