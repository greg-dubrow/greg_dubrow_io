I'm a data analyst/data scientist living in KÃ¸benhavn Denmark, with experitise in higher education systems, policy, undergraduate admissions and student success.

I work in r for everything from data import & cleaning, to analysis, modeling & visualization. I have also used SAS and excel. I have working knowledge of SQL and a passing familiarity with Tableau.

I was born in Denmark and grew up in the US. After many years in San Francisco I lived in Lyon France from May to December 2022 , working as an ESL instructor after earning a CELTA.

In this space I'll mostly be posting code-throughs and results from my personal data projects; music, football (the soccer kind), #tidytuesday data projects and other work. All views expressed here are my own.

Over the years I've [made some music](https://www.discogs.com/artist/1980511-Greg-Dubrow) with [Gosta Berling](https://gostaberling.bandcamp.com/), [Slowness](https://slowness.bandcamp.com/), [Big Still](https://bigstill.bandcamp.com/) and [Idle Wilds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86rp45bp93g).
