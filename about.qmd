I'm a data analyst/data scientist living in KÃ¸benhavn Denmark, with expertise in higher education systems, policy, undergraduate admissions & enrollment management, and student success.

I work in r for everything from data import & cleaning, to analysis, modeling & visualization. I have also used SAS and excel and have working knowledge of SQL and a passing familiarity with Tableau. I can get the gist of Python code, but have not directly worked in the language.

I was born in Denmark and grew up in the US. After many years in San Francisco I lived in Lyon France from May to December 2022 , working as an ESL instructor after earning a [CELTA](https://www.cambridgeenglish.org/teaching-english/teaching-qualifications/celta/) via the [ELT Hub](https://www.theelthub.com/).

In this space I'll mostly be posting code-throughs and results from my personal data projects; music, football (the soccer kind), education, [#tidytuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) data projects and other work. All views expressed here are my own.

Over the years I've [made some music](https://www.discogs.com/artist/1980511-Greg-Dubrow) with [Gosta Berling](https://gostaberling.bandcamp.com/), [Slowness](https://slowness.bandcamp.com/), [Big Still](https://bigstill.bandcamp.com/), [The Trolleyvox](https://www.discogs.com/release/11135216-The-Trolleyvox-Leap-Of-Folly) and [Idle Wilds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86rp45bp93g).
