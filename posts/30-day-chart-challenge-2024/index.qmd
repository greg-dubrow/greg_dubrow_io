## My Plan for the Challenge {#plan}

If you regularly scroll through dataviz social media you probably see lots of posts in April where people show off their work for the [30 Day Chart Challenge](https://github.com/30DayChartChallenge/Edition2024). I never participate in these chart or map challenges because usually they take me by surprise and it's alreayd a week in before I notice and then I figure I'm too late.

Well not this year. Even though I'm (checks calendar) *three weeks* late to the party, I'm going to try and add a few charts to the challenge. I figure it's a good way to keep me consistently creating new visualisations, using the prompts to spur me to think about different data sources and dataviz approaches. My plan is to:

-   Produce charts for as many prompts as possible, working in prompt-day order.
-   Post them to social media on my [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/gregerskjerulf.bsky.social), [Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@Greg_Dubrow), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/greg_dubrow), and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dubrowg/) accounts.
-   Add them to this post, meaning the posting date will refresh to the date I've added the chart.So If I get to alot or even all of them, this will be a long post.
-   Use the table of contents to the right to navigate to a specific chart.

I may not get to every prompt, but I'll do what I can. So let's get going.

## Prompt #1 - Part-to-Whole {#prompt1}

I chose to interpret this prompt by doing a stacked bar chart displaying educational attainment as a proportion of populations by regions in the UK. It doubles as a late-to-the-party entry for the [January 23, 2024 Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2024/2024-01-23) challenge.

The original data is from the UK Office of National Statistics, in a report they produced looking at [educational attainment by socio-economic factors](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/educationandchildcare/articles/whydochildrenandyoungpeopleinsmallertownsdobetteracademicallythanthoseinlargertowns/2023-07-25).

My plan for this was to knock out the chart in about an hour, but I needed up having to do a bit more data transformation than I thought. I also had to read up a bit on UK education [levels](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels) and [stages](https://www.gov.uk/national-curriculum). In the end, it took a few hours to get it as I wanted.

First we'll get and clean the data...

```{r prompt1_1, message=FALSE, ECHO = TRUE, eval= TRUE}

#| message: false 
#| error: false

ukeduc1 <- tt_load("2024-01-23")

# create tibble from csv, clean data, add some fields for the chart
ukeduc <- as_tibble(ukeduc1$english_education) %>%
	mutate(town11nm = ifelse(town11nm == "Outer london BUAs", "Outer London BUAs", town11nm)) %>%
	mutate(ttwa_classification = ifelse(
		town11nm %in% c("Inner London BUAs", "Outer London BUAs"), 
		"Majority conurbation", ttwa_classification)) %>%
	mutate(ttwa11nm = ifelse(
		town11nm %in% c("Inner London BUAs", "Outer London BUAs"), "London", ttwa11nm)) %>%
	mutate(ttwa11cd = ifelse(
		town11nm %in% c("Inner London BUAs", "Outer London BUAs"), "E30000234", ttwa11cd)) %>%
	mutate(across(26:29, ~ifelse(is.na(.),0,.))) %>%
	mutate(level_sum = rowSums(.[c(26:29)])) %>%
	# to get the number of students in the achievement groups we need to multiply the cohort
	# by the percentage and divide by 100 as in the original data they were displayed as 
	# full numbers, eg 17.2 instead of 0.172.
	mutate(highest_level_qualification_achieved_by_age_22_na = 100 - level_sum) %>%
	mutate(n_lesslev1_age22 =
			round(highest_level_qualification_achieved_by_age_22_less_than_level_1 * (ks4_2012_2013_counts/100) ,0)) %>%
	mutate(n_lev1to2_age22 =
			round(highest_level_qualification_achieved_by_age_22_level_1_to_level_2 * (ks4_2012_2013_counts/100) ,0)) %>%
	mutate(n_lev3to5_age22 =
			round(highest_level_qualification_achieved_by_age_22_level_3_to_level_5 * (ks4_2012_2013_counts/100) ,0)) %>%
	mutate(n_lev6plus_age22 =
			round(highest_level_qualification_achieved_by_age_22_level_6_or_above * (ks4_2012_2013_counts/100) ,0)) %>%
	mutate(n_lev_na_age22 =
			round(highest_level_qualification_achieved_by_age_22_na * (ks4_2012_2013_counts/100) ,0))
```

Ok, so we have data, let's make the chart. It's a horizontal bar chart showing the eudcational attainment at age 22 of a cohort of 15-16 year old students who sat for college qualifying exams (GCSEs) in the 2012-13 school year. Meaning the ending time point here is 2018-19. Attainment is plotted by level and by region. Because the original data is by town, we have to group by region to get what we want.

			factor(ed_ettain_age22, 
					levels = c("region_lev_na_age22", "region_levless1_age22", "region_lev1to2_age22", 
							"region_lev3to5_age22",  "region_lev6plus_age22"), 
					labels = c("No data", "Level <1", "Level = 1-2", "Level = 3-5", "Level = 6+"))) %>%
	mutate(ed_attain_pct = ed_attain_n / region_cohort) %>%

		aes(label = scales::percent(round(ed_attain_pct , 2))),
					position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5),
					color= "white", vjust = 0.5, size = 5) +
	labs(title = "Students in London most likely to have at least 4-year degree by Age 22",
		subtitle = "Sixth Year Educational Outcomes for Level 4 2012-13 Cohort by UK Region",
		caption = "*Tidy Tuesday data 01/23/2024, from UK Office of National Statistics*",

	guides(fill = guide_legend(
		label.position = "bottom", reverse = TRUE, 
		title = "Cohort at Age 22", title.position = "top"))
```

We see from this chart that most in regions the rate of 4-year college degree completion (level 6+) was in the mid-high 20s, with students from the London region having the highest rate at 36%.

## Prompt #2 - Neo {#prompt2}

The way I chose to interpret "neo" was by using births by country, or new people by country. The data come from [EuroStat](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat), via the [`eurostat`](https://github.com/rOpenGov/eurostat) package. I'll use total live births and births per 1000 people for the year 2022 (most recent year available). I'll use [`patchwork`](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/) to combine the plots. Unlike prompt 1, this only took a little more than an hour to do.

Getting the data is super simple, and it doesn't need much cleaning, so I'll do all the code in one chunk.

```{r prompt2, message=FALSE, ECHO = TRUE, eval= TRUE}
#| fig.width: 9.0
#| fig.height: 7.0
#| fig-dpi: 300
#| warning: false
#| message: false 
#| error: false
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
#| code-overflow: scroll
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show code for getting data and making the plots"

# to know the table code "tps00204", I had to look up the dataset on-line and copy that value.
# there is a function in the package to list all available data.
births <- eurostat::get_eurostat("tps00204", type = "label", time_format = "num") %>%
	select(-freq) %>%
	rename(year = TIME_PERIOD)

# make the plots
total_births <-
births %>%
	filter(year == 2022) %>%
	filter(indic_de == "Live births - number") %>%
	filter(!grepl("Euro",geo)) %>%
	arrange(desc(values), geo) %>%
	mutate(geo = forcats::fct_inorder(geo)) %>%
	{. ->> tmp} %>%
	ggplot(aes(values, fct_rev(geo))) +
	geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "#FFCC00") +
	scale_y_discrete(position = "right") +
	# need to subset data to get highest label to align similar to the rest
	geom_text(data = subset(tmp, values <800000),
		aes(label = format(values, big.mark=",")),
						color= "#003399", size = 4,
						hjust = -.25, nudge_x = .25) +
	geom_text(data = subset(tmp, values >800000),
						aes(label = format(values, big.mark = ",")),
						color= "#003399", size = 4,
						hjust = 1, nudge_x = .5) +
	labs(y = "", x = "Total Live Births - 2022") +
	theme_minimal() +
	theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor = element_blank())

births_per1k <-
births %>%
	filter(year == 2022) %>%
	filter(indic_de == "Crude birth rate - per thousand persons") %>%
	filter(!grepl("Euro",geo)) %>%
	arrange(desc(values), geo) %>%
	mutate(geo = forcats::fct_inorder(geo)) %>%
	ggplot(aes(values, fct_rev(geo))) +
	geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "#003399") +
	geom_text(aes(label = values),
						position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5),
						color= "#FFCC00", vjust = 0.5, size = 4) +
	labs(y = "", x = "Births per 1000 persons - 2022") +
	theme_minimal() +
	theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor = element_blank())


# put them together with patchwork
library(patchwork)
total_births + births_per1k + plot_annotation(
	title = 'Turkey tops in both total births and births / 1000 people',
	subtitle = 'France only other country top 10 in both measures. San Marino bottom in both',
	caption = 'Data from EuroStats using eurostat package')
```

There you have it. Turkey is tops in both total number of births and births per 1000 people. France is the only other country in the top 10. Interestingly, Spain is near the top in total number (it's a big country) but towards the bottom in births per 1000. San Marino is last in both total births and rate.

What other interesting insights do you see here?

## Prompts #3 & 4 - Redo & Waffle {#prompts3and4}

For this prompt I fulfilled prompt 3 "redo" by redoing the chart for prompt 1, and made it a waffle chart to fulfill prompt 4. I'd never done a waffle chart before, so new chart type...hooray! Cheers to Yann Holtz for his [code-through](https://r-graph-gallery.com/web-waffle-for-time-evolution.html) on his "R Graph Gallery" website to help me better understand how to set-up the data and plot it.

I'm once again using educational attainment data from the UK, via a Tidy Tuesday set from January 2024. We'll get the data and make the chart in the same code chunk.

```

So alright, a waffle chart. Similar insights from the horizontal bar, just visualized a bit differently.

## Prompt #5 - Diverging {#prompt5}

Staying with the theme of educational attainment, but switching countries to Denmark (where I was born and now live again), let's look at differences in educational attainment for people in Denmark aged 25-69. The data come from Danmarks Statistik (Statistics Danmark, the national statistics agency) via the [`danstat`](https://github.com/ValeriVoev/danstat) package. I've been wanting to use the package, this was a great excuse.

I won't do too much explaining about education levels in Denmark, you can read up on them on the [ministry's page](https://ufm.dk/en/education/the-danish-education-system).

The `danstat` package is fairly easy to use once you get the hang of sorting out the table name and number, and variable names and values you need to filter on. It's a good idea to start at Danmarks Statistik's [StatBank page](https://www.statbank.dk/statbank5a/default.asp?w=1680), search the data you want, and when you find the table, you'll see the code, in this case HFUDD11, and use that in the package calls. To see what I mean, let's start with getting the data.

```{r prompt5_1, message=FALSE, ECHO = TRUE, eval= TRUE}
#| warning: false
#| message: false 
#| error: false
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
#| code-overflow: scroll
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show code for getting data"

library(tidyverse) # to do tidyverse things
library(tidylog) # to get a log of what's happening to the data
library(janitor) # tools for data cleaning
library(danstat) # package to get Danish statistics via api
library(ggtext) # enhancements for text in ggplot

# some custom functions
source("~/Data/r/basic functions.R")


# metadata for table variables, click thru nested tables to find variables and ids for filters
table_meta <- danstat::get_table_metadata(table_id = "hfudd11", variables_only = TRUE)

# create variable list using the ID value in the variable
variables_ed <- list(
	list(code = "bopomr", values = "000"),
	list(code = "hfudd", values = c("H10", "H20", "H30", "H35",
										"H40", "H50", "H60", "H70", "H80", "H90")),
	list(code = "køn", values = c("M","K")),
	list(code = "alder", values = c("25-29", "30-34", "35-39", "40-44", "45-49",
												"50-54", "55-59", "60-64", "65-69")),
	list(code = "tid", values = 2023))

# past variable list along with table name. 
# note that in package, table name is lower case, though upper case on statbank page.
edattain <- get_data("hfudd11", variables_ed, language = "da") %>%
	as_tibble() %>%
	select(sex = KØN, age = ALDER, edlevel = HFUDD, n = INDHOLD)

```

The data I pulled is by sex, age, and education level. I needed to age variable to filter for age 25+, as the set starts at age 15. At some point for another post I plan to look a bit more deeply at educational attainment here, including region and age and other fields. So let's clean the data and get it ready to plot a diverging bar chart.

Even though I've calculated percentages for sex by age by education level, I won't be doing any breakdowns by age here, again, that's a later independent post. But at least I have the code now.

```{r prompt5_2, message=FALSE, ECHO = TRUE, eval= TRUE}

Now let's make the plot.

```{r prompt5_3, message=FALSE, ECHO = TRUE, eval= TRUE}
#| fig.width: 9.0
#| fig.height: 7.0
#| fig-dpi: 300
#| warning: false
#| message: false 
#| error: false
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
#| code-overflow: scroll
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show code for making the plot"

vlines_df <- data.frame(xintercept = seq(-100, 100, 20))

edattain1 %>%
	filter(!edlevel == "Not stated") %>%
	distinct(sex, edlevel, .keep_all = TRUE) %>%
	select(sex, edlevel:tot_sex, level_pct, level_pct2 ) %>%
	# pass this temporary set thru to the ggplot call
	{. ->> tmp} %>%
	ggplot() +
	geom_col(aes(x = -50, y = edlevel), width = 0.75, fill = "#e0e0e0") +
	geom_col(aes(x = 50, y = edlevel), width = 0.75, fill = "#e0e0e0") +
	geom_col(aes(x = level_pct2, y = edlevel, fill = sex, color = sex), width = 0.75) +
	scale_x_continuous(labels = function(x) abs(x), breaks = seq(-100, 100, 20)) +
	geom_vline(data = vlines_df, aes(xintercept = xintercept), color = "#FFFFFF", size = 0.1, alpha = 0.5) +
	coord_cartesian(clip = "off") +

				hjust = 1, nudge_x = -.5) +
	geom_text(data = subset(tmp, sex == "Kvinder/Women"),

	labs(x = "", y = "",
			 title = "In Denmark, <span style = 'color: #C8102E;'>women</span> more likely than men for highest education

	theme_minimal() +
	theme(panel.grid = element_blank(), plot.title = element_markdown(),
				plot.subtitle = element_markdown(), plot.caption = element_markdown(),
				legend.position = "none",
				axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10))

```

There it is, a simple, clean chart showing how highest educational attainment differs for women and men in Denmark. I'm definitely interested in exploring differences by age group and by region.

```{r}
#| echo: false
