To some minor chagrin, thanks to someone raising an issue in the [github repo](https://github.com/greg-dubrow/greg_dubrow_io) for the blog, I realised that I was out of compliance with [GDPR rules about website cookies](https://gdpr.eu/cookies/).

I was offering people a more onerus opt-out choice (on the left) when I should have been offering them a clear way to decline (on the right).

A quick search and I found the correction I needed to make, changing the `_quarto.yml` file section on cookie consent from the default. A simple fix, in the `website:` section change `type: implied` (the default) to `type: express`.

Simple, right?

Well...after pushing the changes multiple times, the cookie consent pop-up didn't change.

Some more searching and I came across [this helpful thread](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/discussions/5958) in the quarto dev github repo that touched on my issue. [Declan Naughton](https://models-on-a-plane.pages.dev/) who started the issue offered a solution using another privacy option, [Cookie Consent](https://www.cookieconsent.com/).

While looking into that, downloading the files and planning carefully how to implement it without breaking anything, I got distracted and redid a post to add a table of contents on the right, using `toc: true` in the post yaml. I pushed that, and huh...the GDPR-compliant cookie consent window popped up.

This does beg the question as to why the default in quarto is the non-compliant consent option. Regardless, if you have blog readers in the EU and want to make sure you're compliant, do the following:

-   Change the `_quarto-yml` file so that `cookie-consent:` is `type: express`
-   Add a new post or edit, re-render and push an old post
-   Check and double-check that the compliant cookie pop-up shows
-   If all this talk of cookies makes you hungry, eat cookie!
